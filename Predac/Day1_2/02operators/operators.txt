Operators			Type	Associativity

+     -      ++      --    !	Unary	Right to Left
*      /       %		Binary	Left to Right
+     -				Binary	Left to Right
<    <=      >      >=		Binary	Left to Right
==     !=			Binary	Left to Right
&&				Binary	Left to Right
||				Binary	Left to Right
=    *=    /=    %=    +=    -=	Binary	Left to Right


operatoers are symbols eg. +,*,
operand is data or variable

eg
a+b*c
where a,b,c are operand


Unary 

means single
it operates on only one operand
eg +5,-8.8,a++ ,--a



Binary means two

it operates on more then one operand



Assignment operator




#include<stdio.h>
void main()
{
int a=5;
printf("%d",-a);

}
