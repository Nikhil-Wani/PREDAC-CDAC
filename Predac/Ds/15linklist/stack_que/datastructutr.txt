linear Data Structure:

Linear data structure is linear if element is adjacent to each other. It has exactly two
neighbors elements to which it is connected as its previous and next member.
Example of Linear Data Structure

Array
Linked List
Stack
Queue

Non- Linear Data Structure

Non-Linear data structure is that if one element can be connected to more than two
adjacent element then it is known as non-linear data structure.
Example of non Linear Data Structure:

Tree
Graph
