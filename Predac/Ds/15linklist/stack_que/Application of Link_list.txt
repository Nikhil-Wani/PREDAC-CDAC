circular list
A singly linked circular list is a linked list where the last node in thelist points to the first node in the list. A circular list does not contain NULL pointers.

A good example of an application where circular linked list should be used is a timesharing problem solved by the operating system.

In a timesharing environment, the operating system must maintain a list of present users and must alternately allow each user to use a small slice of CPU time, one user at a time. The operating system will pick a user, let him/her use a small amount of CPU time and then move on to the next user, etc.

For this application, there should be no NULL pointers unless there is absolutely no one requesting CPU time.
