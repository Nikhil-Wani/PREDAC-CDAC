/* constructor is a special member function,which does the 
job of constructing members of the class
it is special because
a) has the same name as of class
b) called automatically when the object is created
c) it has no return type

  there are three types of constructors in c++
  1) default constructor
  2) parameterized constructor
  3) copy constructor

  When we don't write any constructor ,default constructor
  is provided by system
