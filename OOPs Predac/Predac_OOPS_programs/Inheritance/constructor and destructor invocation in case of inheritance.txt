

constructor and destructor invocation in case of inheritance.

when u instantiate child class, child class constructor invokes parent class default constructor. if it is not available u get an error. how will u solve this error? By invoking parent class parameterized constructor explicitly.

destructor is called in the reverse order. i.e. first child class and then parent class.
