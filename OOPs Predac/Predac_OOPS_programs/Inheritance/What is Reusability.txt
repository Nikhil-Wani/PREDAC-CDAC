What is Reusability?

it means designing a new "type" using an existing "type".

e.g. while designing "Car" we can consider existing types such as "FourWheeler" and "Engine".

Reusability can be achieved via two ways:
a) inheritance (is-a  relationship)
b) composition (has-a  relationship)

which is to use when?

when u realize that a new type is "same-as" existing type, u can go for inheritance.
when u realize that new type just needs some functionality of existing type , u can go for composition.
hence in the above example Car and FourWheeler will have "is-a" relationship whereas Car and Engine will have "has-a" relationship.
