

what is Binding?

resolving function call to a function body is called as Binding.
when it happens during compile time , it is called as "Early Binding".
when it happens during runtime it is called as "Late Binding" or "Runtime Polymorphism" or "Dynamic Polymorphism".

From Object Oriented Point of view,in case of Early binding "type" is considered where as in case of Late binding "content" is considered.

if u want "content" to be considered at the time of method invocation, u need to define parent class method as "virtual".
