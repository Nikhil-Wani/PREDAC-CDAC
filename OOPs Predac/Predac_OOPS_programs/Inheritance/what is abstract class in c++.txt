when a class contains at least one pure virtual function, the class becomes abstract in C++.

a pure virtual function is a function which is declared with the keyword virtual and is assigned to zero.

a) abstract class can contain pure virtual functions,virtual functions as well as non-virtual functions. 

b) abstract class can not be instantiated as it is an incomplete class.

c) child class of an abstract class must define pure virtual function/s declared inside parent class or else u can not instantiate that child class.
